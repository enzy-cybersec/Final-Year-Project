This is a project with Vagrant to build an AD setup. it includes a DC, a server and a workstation.
This is used for capturing normal data used for training ML models.
It also can be an attack surface as one can run scripts (such as BadBlood) to make it vulnarble.

**please read and understand all the file as some of the work require manual configuration**

**I have done all the hard work and everything is tested**
		
**ENJOY**
